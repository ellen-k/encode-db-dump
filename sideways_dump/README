Many of the tables in the ModEncode database are in a key-value format.
It would be more convenient to have the keys as column-headings (including one for submission ID) and the vales as the values,
so this script turns the tables "sideways" to achieve this.

(It doesn't actually turn them sideways, but a convenient way to refer to the transformation was necessary.)


USAGE :
Run dump_from_db.rb to pull the tables in their raw ModEncode format to disc.

get_headings.rb is used to get a list of the keys encountered in all the submissions, for
constructing the script to make the result table.



Scripts:

dump_from_db.rb : Pulls raw tables directly from the database.
  requires db_helper.rb and format_helper.rb in parent dir
get_headings.rb -- finds potential column headings from dumped tables.

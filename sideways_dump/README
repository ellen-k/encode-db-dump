Many of the tables in the ModEncode database are in a key-value format.
It would be more convenient to have the keys as column-headings (including one for submission ID) and the vales as the values,
so this script turns the tables "sideways" to achieve this.

(It doesn't actually turn them sideways, but a convenient way to refer to the transformation was necessary.)


USAGE :
---Run dump_from_db.rb to pull the tables in their raw ModEncode format to disk.

---Run get_headings.rb , providing the output directory from dump_from_db.rb, to make
lists of the different possible headings.

--- Run make_table.rb providing the headings from get_headings and the output directory
from dump_from_db to make the table that summarizes all the info.

-- TODO : also have it find "Protocol Types" in the attribute table and connect them
  to the protocols each submission has, as headings.

Scripts:

dump_from_db.rb : Pulls raw tables directly from the database.
  requires db_helper.rb and format_helper.rb in parent dir

get_headings.rb -- finds potential column headings from dumped tables. Sorts output into
  keys which only appear once per submission, and keys which have multiple values.

make_table.rb -- actually makes the table.

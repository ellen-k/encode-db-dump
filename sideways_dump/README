Many of the tables in the ModEncode database are in a key-value format.
It would be more convenient to have the keys as column-headings (including one for submission ID) and the vales as the values,
so this script turns the tables "sideways" to achieve this.

(It doesn't actually turn them sideways, but a convenient way to refer to the transformation was necessary.)

Scripts:

get_headings.rb -- finds potential column headings from dumped tables.

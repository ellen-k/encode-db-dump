Scripts for downloading pages from a mediawiki site by oldid and turning them into pdf files
please see input-sample.conf for setting up your configuration

This requires wkhtmltopdf -- the DL I used on ubuntu is

wkhtmltopdf-0.11.0_rc1-static-i386.tar.bz2

although I'm not confident of the link. from the google repository.
Not sure which I'm using for mac or windows7.
